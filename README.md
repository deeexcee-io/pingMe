## Stupidly Fast Bash Ping Sweep

Part of prepping for my CTL (Cyber Scheme) I have been playing about more with Pivoting, Routers etc. 

HTB Machine Carrier had 22 subnets exposed. I wondered how easy it would be to ping sweep all of them quickly with bash, hence.........pingMe.sh

Ping Sweeped 22 Full Subnets in less than a minute. 

**WARNING** 

It works by simply backgrounding the process. Will use a lot of system resources.
